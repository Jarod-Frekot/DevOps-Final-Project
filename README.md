# DevOps Final Project - Discord Bot

## Project Overview
The goal of our project was to generate a Discord bot (his name is Felix) that responds to certain statements within a Discord channel. Essentially, you can run `vagrant up` and this will start Felix and run his corresponding script. Once that occurs, Felix will be awake and ready to respond within the channel, based on certain keywords or phrases that others write. We are also hosting the project in Heroku's cloud platform. Felix is automatde in the sense that when you run `vagrant up`, he is awake and ready to respond in the channel, and the project is hosted within Heroku's cloud platform automatically.
